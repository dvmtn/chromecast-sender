# Chromecast Sender

Both [@adamwhittingham](http://github.com/adamwhittingham) and [@atleastimtrying](http://github.com/atleastimtrying) have chromecasts that we regularly use for pairing and videos and whatnot.

Why not build a chromecast app!

This is clipped together with [Carabiner](http://github.com/dvmtn/carabiner) and is currently hosted using github pages, it works alongside our [Chromecast Reciever](http://github.com/dvmtn/chromecast)!
